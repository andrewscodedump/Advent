Input is the code for a computer program
	Each quartet of integers is an instruction.
        First number gives the operation (1=add, 2=multiply)
        Second and third give the addresses of the values to be operated on
        Fourth gives the address to write the result to
        Execution ends when the operation is 99

(Test Mode) - What are the contents of register 0 after the program is run
(Live Mode) - As above, but set register 1 to 12 and register 2 to 2 before running.
What values of registers 1 and 2 give an output of 19690720?

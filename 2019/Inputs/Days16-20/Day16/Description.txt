Input is a seed for an error checking routine

Applying an obscure algorithm to the input, repeating 1000 times, what are the first eight digits of the resulting string?
Using the same algorithm, but starting with the original input repeated 10000 times, what are the eight characters starting
at the offset position given by the first seven characters of the input?

Input is the starting location of 4 moons.  Their velocities start off at zero and change based on the positions of the other moons
For each pair, x velocity increases by 1 for the one with the highest x, same for y and z
After all velocities have been calculated new position is calculated based on the speed.
Energy of a moon is sum of absolute of position coordinates times sum of absolute of velocity coordinates

What is the energy of the system after 1000 steps?
After how many steps does the system return to its initial state (could be very, very big).

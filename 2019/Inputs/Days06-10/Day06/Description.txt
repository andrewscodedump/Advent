Input is a list of orbits, where the first item is the planet and the second the satellite.

How many total orbits are there (including indirect orbits, where the planet is in turn orbitting another planet)?
The SAN input gives Santa's location, and the YOU one yours.  What is the minimum number of orbital transfers to get to him?

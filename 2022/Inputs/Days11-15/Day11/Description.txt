Input is a list of monkeys, with the items of yours that they hold
and characteristics that they use to determine which other monkey to throw them to.

Part 1 - After 20 rounds of throwing determine which two monkeys have thrown the most stuff
and return the product of the number of times they've thrown stuff.
Part 2 - Slight change to the calculation, and increase to 10,000 rounds.

Input is a series of paths of rock in a cave.
Sand is falling into the cave from 500,0.  It falls vertically down until it hits rock.
If it hits sand, it goes diagonally left if possible otherwise right.

Part 1 - How many units of sand come to rest before it starts leaving the mapped area?
Part 2 - There's an infinitely wide floor below the bottom of the scan.  How many units of sand come to rest
before there's one at our starting point?

Input is a series of instructions for a circuit diagram.  Each time a button is pressed, it sends a low signal to the broadcast element.
FlipFlop (%):		If input high, nothing happens; if input low, inverts and sends new state
Conjunction (&):	If all sources high, send low, else send high
"broadcaster":		Send input to all outputs

After 1000 button presses, what is the total number of low pulses sent times the number of high.
How many button presses does it take to send a low signal to the "rx" component?

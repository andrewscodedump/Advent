Input is a map of a cave full of mirrors.
A beam of light enters the top left hand corner heading right, and bounces around the hall of mirrors (splitting in two at some points.).

How many unique points (including mirrors) does the beam pass through before exiting?
You can start the beam from anywhere on the edge.  What is the maximum possible number of points passed through?

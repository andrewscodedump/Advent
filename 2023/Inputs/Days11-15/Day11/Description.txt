Input is a map of the night sky, showing galaxies.  Due to cosmic expansion, every line and column containing no galaxies should be doubled.

What is the sum of the (manhattan) distances between each pair of galaxies?
Expansion is bigger than thought.  Each empty row/col should now be a million times bigger!

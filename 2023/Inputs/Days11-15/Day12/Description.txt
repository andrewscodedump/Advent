Input is a set of (damaged) condition records for a series of hot springs.  A question marks means the status is unknown.
The set of numbers at the end gives the length of each contiguous group of damaged (#) springs.

How many different ways of arranging the ?s to match the numbers are there?
As above, but each record is replicated 5 times (separated by ?s).

Input is a series of maps of the ground with a line of mirrors at some point.  Find where the mirrors are by finding a line of symmetry (either horizontal or vertical).

What is the sum of the number of columns to the left of any vertical line plus 100 times the number of rows above a horizontal one?
Each mirror has a smudge, meaning that the symbols have been reversed on a single location.  After cleaning this, what is the new score?

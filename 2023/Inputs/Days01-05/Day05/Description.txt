Input is a list of seeds to be planted and a set of mappings to map each seed to a location, via a series of intermediate mappings.
Each mapping gives start destination and source codes along with how long the start and destination ranges are.

What is the lowest location for the seeds given?
The seeds values are actually pairs of start numbers and lengths.

Input is a pair of seed values for a series of manipulations.  Multiply this by a given value then take modulo 7FFFFFFF.
Repeat, taking the output of the previous round as the input of the next.
After each round, compare the 16 LSBs of the two machines - pass if they are equal.

How many matches after 40M iterations?
As part 1, but 5M iterations, and machine only passes value for comparison if it is a multiple of 4 for machine 1 and 8 for machine 2.

Input is a list of scanners which move up and down a column (first number is the column position, second is the height), once a tick. 
You move along the first row once a tick, being caught if the scanner is in a square when you enter it.

Every time you are caught, you get a score equal to the column number times its height.  What is your total score?
By how many ticks do you have to delay your departure before you can get all the way through without being caught?

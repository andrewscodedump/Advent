Input is a set of transformations.  You have a sqaure grid; if its size is divisible by 2 then split it into 2x2 squares, otherwise 3x3 squares.
Apply the appropriate transformation to each square in turn to create a bigger grid.

How many #'s are in the grid after 5 transformations?
As part 1, but for 18 transformations.

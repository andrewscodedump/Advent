Input is a list of parts to build a bridge with.  The bridge is built domino-wise, starting with 0 on this end.
A bridge's length is the number of parts it is made from, and its strength is the sum of the numbers in the parts it is made from.

What is the strongest bridge that can be made from the parts given?
What is the strength of the longest bridge that can be made (if there's a draw for length, take the strongest one)?

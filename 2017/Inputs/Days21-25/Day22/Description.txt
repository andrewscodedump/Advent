Input is a grid which gives infection status of sectors in a disk.  # = infected, . = clean.  A virus is in the middle, pointing up.
At each turn, it checks the current location, turns left if it's infected, right if it's not then inverts the infection status.

How many times has the virus infected a sector after 10,000 steps?

The infection now cycles through four phases: clean, weakened, infected, flagged, with the virus turning L, F, R, B for each respectively.

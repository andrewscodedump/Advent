Start with a list of bytes.  Input is a list of seeds for an obfuscation routine.
Start at the beginning, and for each seed in turn, take that number of characters (wrapping at the end) and reverse them.
After each reversal, move to the end of the reversed bit and then a bit more (the bit more starting at 0 and increasing by one every time).

After all the manipulations, what is the result of multiplying the first and second numbers.

Instead of treating the input as a list of numbers, treat it as a string and the seeds will be the ASCII values of each character (including the spaces and the commas).
After applying all the manipulations, hash the result by XORing the output in blocks of 16 bytes and output the results as hex.

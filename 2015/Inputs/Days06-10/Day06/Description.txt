The input is a set of instructions to be carried out on a 1000x1000 grid of lights, all initially off.
For part 2, "On" means increase brightness by 1; "Off" means decrease brightness by 1 (minimum 0) and "Toggle" means increase brightness by 2.

How many lights are lit after all instructions have been carried out?
What is the total brightness of the lights at the end?

This is a molecular manipulation machine.  The last part of the input gives the target molecule and the remainder give all of the available manipulations.

How many distinct molecules can be built from the starting molecule by applying one only of the manipulations?
Starting from a single "e", what is the minimum number of manipulations that will give the target molecule?

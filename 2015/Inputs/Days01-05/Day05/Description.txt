The input gives a list of words.  Santa needs to know if they are naughty or nice.
A word is nice if:
It contains at least three vowels; it contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row; it does not contain the strings ab, cd, pq, or xy
For part 2:
It contains a pair of any two letters that appears at least twice in the string without overlapping; it contains at least one letter which repeats with exactly one letter between them.

How many nice words are there in the list?

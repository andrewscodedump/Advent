Input is a set of machine code instructions.
	hlf r - half the value in register r; tpl r - triple it
	inc r - increment register r;
	jmp n - jump forward or back n steps
	jie r,n - jump if r is even; jio r,n - jump if r is odd
Program exits when it tries to access an instruction that doesn't exist

What is the final value in register b?
As above, but set register a to 1 before starting.

Loading Santa's sleigh.  Input gives all the parcels to load.  You have to split these into 3 bundles of the same total weight.
One group should have fewest possible packages.  If more than one with same (fewest) number, take the one with the lowest product of weights.

What is the product of weights in the restricted bundle
Same, but with four groups instead of three.

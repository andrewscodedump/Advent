A list of scores for recipes is being created, starting with 3 and 7.
Elf 1 starts on the first number, elf 2 on the second.  The scores to be added to the end of the list are the
first and second digits of the 2 numbers currently being looked at.
Each elf then moves on to another number in the list by a convoluted algorithm.

After a number of scores equal to the input have been added, what are the next 10 scores?
What is the starting position of a sequence of scores equal to the input numbers?

Input is a set of lines defining the layout of train tracks and the current locations and directions of the carts on them.
Carts move in turn top to bottom one step at a time.  On reaching intersections, a cart turns left first time, straight ahead the second,
right the third and so on.

What is the location of the first crash to happen?
Removing both carts involved in a crash, what is the location of the last one left unscathed?

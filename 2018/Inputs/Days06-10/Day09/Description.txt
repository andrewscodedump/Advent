Input is the number of players and the maximum number of marbles played in an Elvish game
Marbles are placed sequentially in a circle, each new one being placed two clockwise from the latest one
If the marble number is divisible by 23, it is not played, and its number is added to that elf's score,
along with the number of the one seven anti-clockwise from the one last placed (which is then removed).

After all marbles have been played, what is the highest score?

As above, but using 100 times as many marbles.

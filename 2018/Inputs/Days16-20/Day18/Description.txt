The input is a map of an area.  The area will evolve over time: each minute, an open area (.) will grow trees if three or more adjacent areas contain trees;
trees (|) will become a yard if three or more adjacent areas are yards; a yard (#) will stay a yard if it is adjacent to at least one other yard, and
at least one stand of trees, otherwise it becomes open.
The resource value of the area is the number of yards times the number of trees.

What is the value of the area after 10 minutes?
What will its value be after 1,000,000,000 minutes?

The input gives the positions of bands of clay in a 2D cross section of the earth, with a spring at 500,0.
Water from the spring will flow down until it hits clay, at which point it will flow left and right until it hits a wall or flows off an edge.
If clay is found on both sides, then the water will fill up the container until an edge is hit again.

How many points does the water reach?  (Ignoring any below the lowest and above the highest clay).
If the spring stopped running, only the water in "basins" will be retained.  How much of this is there?

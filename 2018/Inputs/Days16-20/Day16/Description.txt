The input is a set of inputs, operations and outputs to a machine code interpreter.
Inputs and outputs give the contents of 4 registers, and the operation gives an op number and inputs to an operation.

How many of the states in the input could be produced by three or more different opcodes?
Work out which ID number represents which opcode, run the code (given in the second half of the input), and return the result in register 0 at the end.

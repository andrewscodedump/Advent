The structure of the ground under your feet (to a depth given in the input) is derived from a convoluted algorithm.
Depending on the nature of the ground, you may need special equipment.  It takes time to move from one area to another
and to equip/dequip.

What is the score of the ground (calculated from the number of each type)?
What is the fastest time to get to the target point (given in the input)?

The input is a description of the make up of the two sides in an attack on an immune system.
Groups attack in order of effective power (number of units * unit power).  Each group selects the enemy group to which it would do the most damage.
The attacks then proceed in order of Initiative of the attacker.

After one side has been wiped out, what are the total number of units left in the surviving side?
Using the smallest possible boost to the immune system's attack points which allows it to win, how many units would it have left at the end?

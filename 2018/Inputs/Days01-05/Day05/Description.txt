The input is the formula for a molecule.  If two adjacent elements are the same type but opposite polarity (upper and lower case), they annihilate.

What length of molecule is left after all annihilations take place?
What is the shortest possible length of the remaining molecule if all of one given letter (both cases) is removed before processing?

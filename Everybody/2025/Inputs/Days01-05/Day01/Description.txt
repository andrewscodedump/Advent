Input is a list of names and a set of instructions for navigating through them.

Starting from the beginning of the list and taking the instructions at face value, what name do you end up on?
The list is actually a circular loop.  Where do you end up now?
Still using a loop, each step now swaps position 0 and the name pointed to by the instruction.  What name ends up in position zero?

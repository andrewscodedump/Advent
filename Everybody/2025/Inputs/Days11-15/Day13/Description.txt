Input is a list of numbers for a combination lock.  Numbers are added to the lock alternately on the right and left of the dial.

What number does the lock end up on if it is turned 2025 times?
Inputs are now ranges, added in the same way (all numbers in a range on the same side).  Number of turns is now 20252025.
As above, but much bigger ranges, and 202520252025 turns.

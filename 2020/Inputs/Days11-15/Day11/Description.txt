Input is a layout of seats.  L is empty, # is occupied, . is not a seat.
Seats are filled or occupied by a cellular automaton based on the number of neighbouring seats occupied.

Once the seat changes settle down to a steady state, how many are occupied?
As above, but rather than immediate neighbours, uses the first seats visible in a straight line.

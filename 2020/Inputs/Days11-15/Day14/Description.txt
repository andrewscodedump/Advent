Input is a set of binary masks (X = ignore, 0/1 = change bit to 0/1) and a set of instructions for populating memory registers.

Modifying each value by the mask active at that time, what is the sum of the registers after the code executes?
As above, but now the mask operates on the register address, not the value.  0=ignore, 1=set bit, X=set all possible values for that bit.

You're using an algorithm to generate random data to scrub a disk.
Starting from the input, copy the string, reverse it, change all the 0s to 1s and 1s to zeros, then the
output will be the starting string plus a 0 plus the mutated string.  Repeat until it is long enough to fill the disk.
The checksum is calculated by trimming the final string to fit the disk and comparing pairs of characters; if they match, return 1 else 0.  Repeat until the checksum has an odd number of digits.

The disk has a capacity of 272.  What is the checksum?
As above, but the capacity is 35651584.

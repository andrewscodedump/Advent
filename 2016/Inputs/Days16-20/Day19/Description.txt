Ring of elves, with presents.  Starting from 1, each elf takes the present from the elf to their left, who then leaves the ring.
Input gives the number of elves at the start

Which elf ends up with all the presents.
As above, but instead of taking from the left, take from the elf directly opposite (the leftmost if there are two).

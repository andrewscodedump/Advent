Input is a list of rooms.
Letters and dashes at the start give the room name (encrypted); numbers give the sector number and letters in brackets give the checksum.
Checksum is valid if it contains the 5 commonest letters in the room name in order of commonness (ties are in alphabetical order).
Room names are decrypted by rotating forward the letters by the number of characters in the sector name (wrapping at z).

Give the sum of the sector numbers for all rooms with valid checksums.
What is the sector ID of the room in which the North Pole Objects are stored?

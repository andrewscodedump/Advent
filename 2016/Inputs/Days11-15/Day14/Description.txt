Input is an initial key for a key generation routine.  Keys are generated by hashing the input plus an increasing counter.
A key is valid if it contains the same character 3 times in a row and the same character 5 times in a row in the following 1000 keys.

What is the counter of the first valid key?
As part 1, but when generating a key, each hash should be performed on its own output 2016 times
